# Drop_in_Project

## Introduction
As a casual badminton player in Taiwan, it can be challenging to find suitable drop-in events
due to the seasonal rental contract system for courts. While the "Badminton Puzzle"
platform provides a drop-in post for players to make casual playing arrangements, keeping
track of the website for suitable events can be time-consuming and daunting. To simplify this
process, an automatic robot can be created to notify me per hour of the best drop-in events
that match my preferences.

## Background
"Badminton Puzzle" provides a platform for drop-in posts and allows players to filter events
based on their preferences, aiming to provide a more seamless playing experience for casual
players in Taiwan. Automatic notices about drop-in events would further streamline the
process by alerting players to available playing opportunities in real-time, reducing the time
and effort required to search for suitable playing arrangements. However, it's important to
consider potential negative impacts, such as inaccurate information, exclusion of certain
players or groups, and reduced social interaction. Overall, while the use of an automatic
robot can be a valuable tool in promoting greater engagement in badminton, careful
consideration and mitigation of any negative impacts is necessary.
